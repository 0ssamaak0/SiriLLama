# Installation

2. Install Langchain and Flask & run the flask app
```
pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain langchain-openai
pip install flask
```
3. Download the shortcut from [here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3bf9c6400e5049dd81b2df1e16754d3a)

4. Enter your local IP address and the Flask port in the shortcut

5. Run the shortcut through Siri or the shortcut UI

# Note
**SiriLLama** is the most simple langchain chatbot, there's huge room for improvement and customization, including model selection (even through OpenAI, Anthropic API), RAG Applications or better LLM Memory options, etc.

# Common Issues
- Even we access the flask app (not Ollama server directly), Some windows users who have Ollama installed via `WSL` have to make sure **ollama servere** is exposed to the network, [Check this issue for more details](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/1431)
