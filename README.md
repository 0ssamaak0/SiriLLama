# Getting Started
## Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Ollama Installationü¶ô
1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for your machine, you have to run `ollama serve` in the terminal to start the server

2. pull the models you want to use, for example
```bash
ollama run llama3 # chat model
ollama run llava # multimodal
```

3. in `config.py` set `OLLAMA_CHAT`, `OLLAMA_VISUAL_CHAT`, and `OLLAMA_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL` to the models you pulled from Ollama
### Fireworks AI InstallationüéÜ

1. get your [Fireworks API Key](http://fireworks.ai/) and put it in `fireworks_models.py`

2. in `config.py` set `FIREWORKS_CHAT`, `FIREWORKS_VISUAL_CHAT` and `FIREWORKS_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL` to the models you want to use from Fireworks AI. and set your and `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` 

## Config
in `confing.py` set `MEMORY_SIZE` (How many previous messages to remember) and `ANSWER_SIZE_WORDS` (How many words to generate in the answer)

## Running SiriLlama üü£ü¶ô

1. [Download](https://github.com/0ssamaak0/SiriLLama/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone the repo 

2. [set the provider (Ollama / Fireworks)](https://github.com/0ssamaak0/SiriLLama/blob/d07ff97a0eb07db08601e5e3fe0254c6f05aee50/app.py#L18) in `app.py` 

3. Run the flask app using
```bash
>>> python3 app.py
```

4. On your Apple device, Download the shortcut from [here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fd032a4e75cc4d81a6f9a742053d4c18)
   Note that you must run the shortcut through Siri to "talk" to it, otherwise it will prompt you to type text.

5. Run the shortcut through Siri or the shortcut UI, in first time you run the shortcut you will be asked to enter your [IP address](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15864222) and the port number showing in terminal
```bash
>>> python app.py
...
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5001
 * Running on http://192.168.1.134:5001
Press CTRL+C to quit
```
In the example above, the IP address is `192.168.1.134` and the port is `5001` (default port is specified by Flask, change the line in main.py if needed)

6. If you are using Siri to interact with the shortcut, saying "Good Bye" will stop Siri.



# Common Issues üêû
- Even we access the flask app (not Ollama server directly), Some windows users who have Ollama installed using `WSL` have to make sure **ollama servere** is exposed to the network, [Check this issue for more details](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/1431)
- When running the shortcut for the first time from Siri, it should ask for permission to send data to the Flask server.
  If it doesn't work (especially on iOS 17.4), first try running the shortcut + sending a message from the iOS Shortcuts app to trigger the permissions dialog, then try running it through Siri again.

# Other LLM Providers ü§ñü§ñ
Supposedly SiriLLama should work with any LLMs that including OpenAI, Claude, etc. but make sure first you installed the corresponding Langchain packages and set the models in `config.py`
